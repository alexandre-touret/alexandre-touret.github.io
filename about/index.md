# About


I expose on this blog my tests, technical musings and explorations.
Among other things, it helps me remind me what I did months/years ago and sharing it to the community.

By default, the content is published under the [Creative Commons CC BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Obviously, I accept remarks, fixes (nobody is perfect). However, I reserve the right to publish or not a comment.
Usually, I publish it except if I consider it as a [troll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(slang)).

You probably understood it's a personal blog and not a professional one.
I publish also articles on the [Worldline Technical Blog](https://blog.worldline.tech/).

Finally, views and opinions exposed on this blog are my own and not of my employer.
  
And now, enjoy! ðŸ™‚
