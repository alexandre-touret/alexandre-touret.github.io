I expose on this blog my tests, technical musings and explorations.
Among other things, it helps me remind me what I did months/years ago and sharing it to the community.

By default, the content is published under the [Creative Commons CC BY license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Obviously, I accept remarks, fixes (nobody is perfect). However, I reserve the right to publish or not a comment.
Usually, I publish it except if I consider it as a [troll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(slang)).

You probably understood it's a personal blog and not a professional one.
I publish also articles on the [Worldline Technical Blog](https://blog.worldline.tech/).

Finally, views and opinions exposed on this blog are my own and not of my employer.

## AI usage

{{< admonition type=info title="What about Generative AI?" >}}
The content on this blog was written by me, not by an AI!
{{< /admonition >}}

Generally speaking, I would rather not write an article than fully generate it entirely from a LLM.

I only use LLM :
- to fix my english articles and make them sounding like more "native
- to get sometimes inspiration or use them as a search engine on steroid

By the way, this precision is inspired from the article of [D. GERMAIN](https://blog.zwindler.fr/ai-manifesto/) and [C. WILLIAMS](https://cassidoo.co/ai/)

And now, enjoy! ðŸ™‚
