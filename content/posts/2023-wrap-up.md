## 2023 in few words
2024 is coming.
It is time to review 2023 in a professional point of view.

I have been carrying on working on both a customer project and on behalf of the Worldline TechRel[^1] initiative. 

Among other things, I feel lucky to have participated as a speaker to:
* 6 tech conferences
* 3 meetups
* 1 online presentation (i.e., BBL) for ABBEAL

Unlike last year, It happened to me to present two talks or one talk and one workshop at the same conference.
It was tricky, exhausting but exciting at once!

I therefore presented as many talks as in 2022.

I proposed this year three main topics:
* [Rest API Versioning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8DbVbMDe2w)
* [The Hitchhiker's guide to software architecture design](https://youtu.be/vxwqD3KwdEY?si=n7L4p0USvdADFuct)
* [The architecture katas](https://youtu.be/xLhb3mvweDI)

I furthermore was also part of the last [JChateau Edition](http://jchateau.org/). 
It was my first time attending an "unconference".
I was a blast! 

I met and chatted on various topics with many interesting and inspiring people such as [Jean-Michel Doudoux](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmdoudoux/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_people_connections%3Bb0ogWmkZSA%2BqSqaqCW4rDw%3D%3D), [Andres Almirez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aalmiray/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_people_connections%3Bb0ogWmkZSA%2BqSqaqCW4rDw%3D%3D) or [José Paumard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-paumard-2458ba5/).

I also wrote 6 articles on [my blog](https://blog.touret.info/) and 1 on the [Worldline engineering blog](https://blog.worldline.tech/authors/#alexandre-touret).

Thank you to my employer for giving me this opportunity and the organisers for their trust and their hospitality. I'm pretty sure you will recognise yourselves.
Thanks then to who helped me in my speaker journey.

## And now, something completely different?

On behalf of the [^2]Worldline tech rel initiative, I had the chance to meet great people and move forward in some technical domains. Drawing up and submitting a talk about a technical topic requires you to dig into it and be proficient on it.
I already have ideas for the next year.
I will start with a bang because I will hold a workshop at NDC London in late January and present a new talk with my colleague Philippe Duval at [Touraine Tech](https://touraine.tech)

Best wishes for the new year eve and if you come across this article in 2024: Happy new year!!


[^1]: c'est comme des dev rel mais on essaye d'inclure au delà des devs (ex. les OPS, SRE).
[^2]: It is just like dev rel, but we would like to include all the tech crew (e.g., OPS & SRE)
