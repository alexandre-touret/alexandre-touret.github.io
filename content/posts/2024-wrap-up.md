## 2024 in a Nutshell
As 2024 draws to a close, it’s time to cast a professional eye back on this year.

Like last year, I have balanced working on a customer project alongside my contributions to the Worldline TechRel[^1] initiative. I had the opportunity to shift to another team. Although I keep working on the Transport & Monbility field, I have discovered a new product & met new colleagues.

In addition, I also started teaching at the [University of Tours](https://www.univ-tours.fr/). I strive to provide [my return of experience on the following topics: Microservices Architecture, SQL Basics & Business Processes](https://blog.touret.info/teaching/).

I have then published the courses under the [Creative Commons International Attribution 4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en). Feel free to [(re-)use them and submit issues](https://blog.touret.info/teaching/). I am quite sure I made somes mistakes.

## Speaking

I had several speaking engagements times this year. 

Here are some highlights of my [appearances](https://blog.touret.info/speaker-resume/#2024):

- 3 international tech conferences : NDC London, Geecon Krakow, Devoxx Morocco
- 4 French tech conferences: Touraine Tech, Riviera Dev, Volcamp, API Days Paris
- 2 local meetups: Bordeaux JUG, Poitou JUG
- A Worldline tech event in Seclin (France)

Like last year, I found myself presenting up to three talks, or workshops at the same event. As I said last year, I extended the parterships with other speakers  I then we co-presented most of my 2024 talks with my Wordline colleagues [Raphaël Semeteys](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/raphaelsemeteys), [Philippe Duval](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phduval/) & [David Pequegnot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidpequegnot/).

I definitevely enjoy sharing the stage with co-speakers. Although the preparation can be tricky due to the organisation (busy agenda versus online preparation meetings), I think the content provided is usually better and I learn a lot new things during the preparation.

Here are some topics I shared in 2024:

* [Implementing API-First Approach: Practical Insights for Streamlining Your APIs](http://blog.touret.info/talks/#implementing-api-first-approach-practical-insights-for-streamlining-your-apis)
* [Intégrons, faisons grandir et progresser les jeunes devs: Bonnes pratiques et retours d’expériences à l’intention des (vieux) devs.](http://blog.touret.info/talks/#int%c3%a9grons-faisons-grandir-et-progresser-les-jeunes-devs-bonnes-pratiques-et-retours-dexp%c3%a9riences-%c3%a0-lintention-des-vieux-devs)
* [L’observabilité dès le développement: Maîtrisez vos applications Java en production](http://blog.touret.info/talks/#lobservabilit%c3%a9-d%c3%a8s-le-d%c3%a9veloppement-ma%c3%aetrisez-vos-applications-java-en-production-avec-grafana)
* [Let’s Learn to Identify Technical Requirements for Better Design](http://blog.touret.info/talks/#lets-learn-to-identify-technical-requirements-for-better-design)

I also participated in [the JChateau Unconference](http://jchateau.org/). Interacting again with inspiring individuals like [Jean-Michel Doudoux](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmdoudoux/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_people_connections%3Bb0ogWmkZSA%2BqSqaqCW4rDw%3D%3D), [Andres Almirez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aalmiray/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_people_connections%3Bb0ogWmkZSA%2BqSqaqCW4rDw%3D%3D), or [José Paumard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-paumard-2458ba5/) confirmed I really enjoy this format. 
You learn more in 2-3 days there than in any other conference.

I will repeat myself, but I express a new time my gratitude to my employer for the continued opportunities and to the organizers for their unwavering trust and hospitality.

The Worldline TechRel initiative has been instrumental in exploring new topics and facilitating collaborations with colleagues. 
It has enabled me to share, gather feedback on submissions, and conduct live rehearsals (Thanks [Yassine Benabbas](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/benabbasyassine), [Philippe Vincent](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippe-vincent-732a3217/) and the others).

## Articles

During the year, I released five articles on [my blog](https://blog.touret.info/) and one on the [Worldline engineering blog](https://blog.worldline.tech/authors/#alexandre-touret). 
Additionally, I published an article into the French tech magazine Programmez (#266). I [described how to implement observability in a Java application with OpenTelemetry](https://www.programmez.com/magazine/article/dossier-special-24-devs-temoignent-de-leur-quotidien).
This last experience was enriching. Writing an article for a magazine is complex and requires more rigor than writing a blog post. Like for my talks, I leant of my colleagues for reviewing and giving feedbacks (Thanks [Jean-Michel Girard](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jmichel-girard) & the others). 

## What' next?

I will start 2025 off to a flying start. I will present in late January two talks and will lead two workshops: two at [SnowcampIO](https://snowcamp.io/) (Including one with [David Pequegnot](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidpequegnot/)) and two at [Touraine Tech](https://touraine.tech/).

I don't know yet whether I will more focus on teaching than in speaking at tech conferences. Time will tell.

Anyway, wishing everyone merry christmas, a fantastic New Year's Eve, and a Happy New Year!
