## Introduction

I had the opportunity to participate at [JChateau](https://www.jchateau.org/) and [Devoxx France](https://www.devoxx.fr/agenda-2025/talk/ensemble-faisons-progresser-et-grandir-les-developpeurs-debutants). 
At these two events, I arranged and held round-tables on how to onboard, mentor and manage young developers to let them improve themselves over the time.

For a long time, I've been managing young developers. They could be either trainees or developers with less than 1 year of experience. 
Furthermore, I was also involved in different mentoring programs. For instance, I helped some young student get their first interview and prepare them to make them successfull. 

Finally, since last year, I've been teaching at the University of Tours.

All of these experiences, especially at the beginning of my career, made me slightly frustrated or having mixed feelings. Why? Because, I had the vague impression to reinvent the wheel. I was pretty sure people had been struggling on that topic or had founded smart solutions or patterns to apply for it. 

That's why I've been sharing my experience on that field in different ways:
- Conferences
- Workshops
- Articles

I met them a high demand on that topic. 
Every time I talk about it, this problematic rang a bell to all the attendees.

For instance, at Devoxx France, I was delighted to see more than 40 people attending my BOF (at 7PM!!!) and share their experience on that field.

Therefore, I will try to wrap up all the conclusions, questions, remarks I came accross during these insightful discussions.
