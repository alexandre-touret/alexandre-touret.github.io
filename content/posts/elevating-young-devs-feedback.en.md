## Introduction

Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in [JChateau](https://www.jchateau.org/) and [Devoxx France](https://www.devoxx.fr/agenda-2025/talk/ensemble-faisons-progresser-et-grandir-les-developpeurs-debutants). 
At these two events, I organized and facilitated roundtables on how to onboard, mentor, and manage young developers to help them grow and improve over time.

For many years, I have been managing young developers, including trainees and developers with less than one year of experience. 
Additionally, I have been involved in various mentoring programs. For example, I have helped young students prepare for their first interviews and guided them to succeed.

Since last year, I have also been teaching at the University of Tours.

These experiences, especially early in my career, often left me feeling slightly frustrated or conflicted. Why? Because I had the impression of reinventing the wheel. I was certain that others had faced similar challenges and had developed smart solutions or patterns to address them.

This is why I have been sharing my experiences in this field through various channels:
- Conferences
- Workshops
- Articles

I have noticed a high demand for discussions on this topic. 
Every time I speak about it, the subject resonates strongly with the audience.

For instance, at Devoxx France, I was thrilled to see more than 40 people attend my BOF (at 7 PM!) and share their experiences on this topic.

As a result, I will attempt to summarize all the conclusions, questions, and insights I encountered during these meaningful discussions.

## JChateau
I proposed this topic at JChateau. Although it was far beyond the usual technical topics, I managed to arrange a roundtable with four people on the second day.  
The discussions were truly insightful. The audience consisted of seasoned engineers, software architects, and one person involved in training young students.

We agreed that there is a significant gap between the way coding is taught at universities or engineering schools and how it is practiced in IT companies. The skills learned at school often don't align with the requirements of a real-life production platform.

To some extent, it's more important _to learn how to learn_ through algorithms, mathematics, and analysis than to simply learn the latest trendy framework.  
The pace of technological evolution is both overwhelming and fascinating.  
Moreover, the learning curve for developers is incredibly steep nowadays. Beyond mastering a favorite programming language, one must also learn to use Docker, build tools, Bash, database tools/queries, cloud commands, and many others.  
It's nearly impossible to address all these skills comprehensively in school.

That's why, when I'm looking for a new young engineer, I prioritize a _well-prepared mind_ over specific technical skills.

We also shared a common observation:  
It's essential to teach the basics while onboarding young developers: logs, error management, tests, and so on.

The million-dollar question then arose: Who should take responsibility for this—universities/schools or our industry?

In conclusion, we leaned slightly toward the idea that our industry should share a common program to teach the fundamentals of development.  
At this stage, I am unsure whether we should adopt a bottom-up or a top-down approach. I assume that some large IT companies already have onboarding and training programs for this purpose.  
It would be fantastic if we could pool our efforts and, for example, create a dedicated open-source project with materials such as workshops, documentation, and more.
