## Conclusion
Unfortunately, I haven't read plenty of fascinating books yet.
Regarding software architecture or design topics, I usually choose a book taking a look on [the Gregor Hohpe bookshelf](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/architect-bookshelf/) first.
You will find many of the books I already mentioned in this article and many more!
