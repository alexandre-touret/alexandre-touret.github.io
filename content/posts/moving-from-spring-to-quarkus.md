After mostly a decade coding with Spring Boot, I chose to switch to Quarkus for a workshop about API-First ... and was quite late to the party ...

Furthermore, I already gave it a spin few years ago and I was not really convinced by the worthiness of such a move. By the way, I presented in 2022 a talk about that topic with a former colleague of mine [Jean-Fran√ßois James](https://jefrajames.fr/). 
We compared both of the two solutions and our conclusion was the functionalities provided by Spring Boot & Quarkus were sightly similar.

2-3 years passed. I then decided to use it and see how it has evolved.
Some points still miss, but nevertheless I was really impressed.
I will then try to sum up in this article my journey so far from a developer point of view.

## The context

## Developer experience

## Tools & Framework integration

## API-First

Generation

Swagger/ Small Rye

## Persistence

## Difficulties and some functionalities still missing (from my point of view)

## Conclusion
