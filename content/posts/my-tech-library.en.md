Early in my career, when the documentation was not so spearded across the Internet, I had to buy and crack open books to learn new things.
I stumbled upon the shelves of [Le Monde en "Tique"](https://ilibrairie.fr/75/paris/le-monde-en-tique-1zu), a famous Parisian bookstore getting books of Java EE, XML, or whatever else.

I then realised, even with the number of documentation, articles, videos growing on Internet, I learnt far better new topics reading books.

All along my career I therefore tried to keep this habit.
During the last [Touraine Tech](https://touraine.tech/) edition, I had a chat with one of my ex-colleague about that. 
I asked me: _"Do you have a list of the best books you read and enjoyed? It could be nice if not"_ 

I will therefore try to reply here to this query.

You will find below a bunch of books I found really helpful at different steps of my career.
Please, remind this list is not exhaustive and there is plenty of interesting books beyond this list.

## The staple
Here are few books I strongly recommend to read and read again to every developer in this particular order.

### Clean code by R. C. MARTIN
{{< figure src="/assets/images/2024/02/cleancode.webp" title="Clean Code" >}}
For few years, when I must mentor a young developer, I ask him/her to read Clean code first and code then.

### Refactoring by M. FOWLER
{{< figure src="/assets/images/2024/02/refactoring.webp" title="Refactoring" >}}
I must admit, I am a big fan of [M. FOWLER](https://martinfowler.com/). 
Every of his presentations, articles or books are really informative and inspiring.
In my opinion, this book belongs to the mandatory reading list for every people who want to become better in this field.

### Design Patterns by the GoF
{{< figure src="/assets/images/2024/02/gof.webp" title="Design Patterns by the GoF" >}}

One of the first tech book I bought. 
It is still useful.

## For Java developers
### Head First Java by K. SIERA & B. BATES
{{< figure src="/assets/images/2024/02/head_first_java.webp" title="Head First Java" >}}

### Effective Java by J. BLOCH
{{< figure src="/assets/images/2024/02/effective_java.webp" title="Effective Java" >}}

## For designers
### Fundamentals of Software Architecture by M. RICHARDS & N. FORD
{{< figure src="/assets/images/2024/02/fundamentals_sa.webp" title="Fundamentals of Software Architecture" >}}

It is definitively the book I would have wished to read 10+ years ago!
In my opinion, reading this book is a mandatory step for every people who want to dig into architecture. 
It addresses both the hard skills with all the main architecture design patterns and the soft skills (i.e., how to work as an architect?). 

### Software architecture for developers: Technical Leadership and the balance with agility by S. BROWN
{{< figure src="/assets/images/2024/02/software_arch_for_developers.webp" title="Software architecture for developers: Technical Leadership and the balance with agility" >}}

This is another great book talking about software architecture.  
I also recommend reading it.

### Building Microservices by S. NEWMAN
{{< figure src="/assets/images/2024/02/microservices.webp" title="Building Microservices" >}}

If you want to dig into how to design a microservice platform, this book is a good start.
It will provide you a good overview of all the main points to tackle such as integration, deployment, or the famous [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law).

### Building Evolutionary Architectures by N. FORD, R. PARSONS & P. KUA
{{< figure src="/assets/images/2024/02/evolutionary.webp" title="Building Evolutionary Architectures" >}}

This book comforted me a platform must be on the one hand designed and sat up as simply as possible and on the other hand supports changes over the time.
Among other things, the authors bring guidance to achieve that.

## For speakers
### Resonate by N. DUARTE
{{< figure src="/assets/images/2024/02/resonate.webp" title="Resonate" >}}

I read this book recently. 
It is considered as a reference for people who talk in public. 
It is also my opinion.

## For people who want to get rid of stress and being organised
### Getting Things Done by D. ALLEN
{{< figure src="/assets/images/2024/02/gtd.webp" title="getting Things Done" >}}

Last but not least, this book changed 15 years ago the way I organised both my personal and professional life. 
This kind of personal life methodology does not work for everyone.
For me, it was a game changer.

## Conclusion
Unfortunately, I didn't read plenty of fascinating books yet.
I usually choose a book which talks about architecture or design based on [the Gregor Hohpe bookshelf](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/architect-bookshelf/).
You will find many of the books I already mentioned in this article and many more!
