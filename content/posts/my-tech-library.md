Early in my career, when the documentation was not so spearded across the Internet, I had to buy and crack open books to learn new things.
I stumbled upon the shelves of Le Monde en "Tique", a famous parisian book store getting books of Java EE, XML, or whatever else.

I then realised, even with the number of documentation, articles, videos growing on Internet, I learnt far better new topics reading books.

All along my career I therefore tried to keep this habit.
During the last [Touraine Tech](https://touraine.tech/) edition, I had a chat with one of my ex-colleague about that. 
I asked me: _"Do you have a list of the best books you read and enjoyed? It could be nice if not"_ 

I will therefore try to reply here to this query.

You will find below a bunch of books I found really helpful at different steps of my career.
Please, remind this list is not exhaustive and there is plenty of interesting books beyond this list.

## Conclusion
There is also plenty of really interesting books I didn't read yet.
I usually base my reading choice on [the Gregor Hohpe bookshelf](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/architect-bookshelf/).
You will find many of the books I already mentioned in this article and many more!
