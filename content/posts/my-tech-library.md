Early in my career, when the documentation was not so spearded across the Internet, I had to buy and crack open books to learn new things.
I stumbled upon the shelves of Le Monde en "Tique", a famous parisian book store getting books of Java EE, XML, or whatever else.

I then realised, even with the number of documentation, articles, videos growing on Internet, I learnt far better new topics reading books.

All along my career I therefore tried to keep this habit.
During the last [Touraine Tech](https://touraine.tech/) edition, I had a chat with one of my ex-colleague about that. 
I asked me: _"Do you have a list of the best books you read and enjoyed? It could be nice if not"_ 

I will therefore try to reply here to this query.

You will find below a bunch of books I found really helpful at different steps of my career.
Please, remind this list is not exhaustive and there is plenty of interesting books beyond this list.

## The staple
Here are few books I strongly recommend to read and read again to every developer in this particular order.

### Clean code by R. C. MARTIN
{{< figure src="/assets/images/2024/02/cleancode.webp" title="Clean Code" >}}
For few years, when I must mentor a young developer, I ask him/her to read Clean code first and code then.

### Refactoring by M. FOWLER
{{< figure src="/assets/images/2024/02/refactoring.webp" title="Refactoring" >}}
I must admit, I am a big fan of [M. FOWLER](https://martinfowler.com/). 
Every of his presentations, articles or books are really informative and inspiring.
This book belong to the mandatory reading list for every people who want to improve in this field.

### Design Patterns by the GoF

It is still useful.

## Conclusion
There is also plenty of really interesting books I didn't read yet.
I usually base my reading choice on [the Gregor Hohpe bookshelf](https://architectelevator.com/architecture/architect-bookshelf/).
You will find many of the books I already mentioned in this article and many more!
