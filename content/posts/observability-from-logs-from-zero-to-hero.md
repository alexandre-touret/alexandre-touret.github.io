## The sad reality

Imagine, it's Friday afternoon.
You're eager to enjoy your weekend when an Ops engineer forwards you a blocking issue with an HTTP 500 error.

Unfortunately, he couldn't identify the root cause due to a lack of contextual information.
After a few hours, you finally manage to identify it by reproducing and debugging it on your computer.

Are you used with such a scenario? 
If yes, you probably didn't identify one of your end users and their main usage: Your Ops and the observability!

I will first address in this article some of the best practices I gathered and applied through the years. 
I then show you how to combine logs and traces to provide clearer insights of your platform and make OPS your best friends.
