## The sad reality

Picture this: it's Friday afternoon, and you're eagerly looking forward to unwinding for the weekend. 
Suddenly, an Ops engineer alerts you about a critical issueâ€”a stubborn HTTP 500 error that's causing a major roadblock.

Despite their efforts, the Ops engineer couldn't pinpoint the root cause due to a lack of contextual information.

Hours pass by, but you take it upon yourself to delve into the problem. 
Eventually, after reproducing and debugging the issue on your computer, you uncover the issue.

Do you think it is science fiction?
Are you used with such a scenario? 

If yes, you probably didn't identify one of your end users and their main usage: Your Ops and the observability!

In this article, I aim to share a collection of best practices gleaned from years of experience.
I will then outline how to merge logs and traces to gain clearer insights into your platform's workings. 
By doing so, you can transform your relationship with Ops teams, making them your best friends.

## A definition of Observability
Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of a complex system. 
When a system is observable, a user can identify the root cause of a performance problem by examining the data it produces, without additional testing or coding.

This is one of the ways in which quality of service issues can be addressed.

## Logs, Traces & Monitoring

To make a system fully observable, the following abilities must be implemented:
* Logs
* Metrics
* Traces

They can be defined as follows:

## Logs

## Traces

## Combine both with monitoring
