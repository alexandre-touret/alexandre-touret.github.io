## Once upon a time an API ...

> “No matter how it looks at first, it’s always a people problem”

Second Law of Consulting - Gerald M. Weinberg

Once upon a time the ACME Corporation was building a brand new IT product. 

It aimed at a new way managing bookstores through a new software which provides a web interface and an API.

At the early steps, the developers drew up a first roadmap of their API based on the expectations of their first customers.

They therefore built and shipped a microservices platform and released their first service contract for their early adopters.

## The platform and its roadmap

After shipping this platform into production, they defined a roadmap for their existing customers to both improve the existing features and bring new ones.

At as of now, we could think everything is _hunky dory_ isn't it?
