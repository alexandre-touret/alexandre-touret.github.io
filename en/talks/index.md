## Talks

Here is a bunch of talks I presented at various tech events (meetups, conferences).
You can find talks in French on [the corresponding part of this blog](/talks).


### The Hitchhiker's guide to software architecture design

{{< admonition abstract "Abstract" false >}}
Designing a new platform is always tricky to set up.

How to start? What is the best strategy to adopt while designing a platform? What kind of architecture should we deploy: event streaming, orchestration, or choreography?

For a brand-new platform: "Donuts @ Home", we will proceed a live architecture study.

After analysing the customer needs, brainstorming, and exchanging our ideas, we will choose among all the potential solutions the *least worst* option.

You will be asked to validate our design and the different implementation examples.

At the end of this talk, you will have tips and tricks for thinking about it and starting working on architecture studies in complete peace of mind.

### Architecture Katas : Improve your system architecture design skills in a funny way
{{< admonition abstract "Abstract" false >}}

How to learn architecture ? How to improve in this field ? How do we recognize a good or a bad architecture ?
Plenty of books and training sessions address this subject. The best thing is to practice!
In the same way as CodingDojos, I will present to you architecture katas. 
Ted NEWARD (http://blogs.tedneward.com/) created them. His idea came from the following observation :
"How are we supposed to get great architects, if they only get the chance to architect fewer than a half-dozen times in their career?"
One solution to this issue could be to practice regularly on several topics to gain experience.
After a brief introduction of how to start designing an architecture, I will present architecture katas, and the conduct.
To conclude, after this first try I will present the benefits I had benefited.

### Kubernetes & Co, beyond the hype: 10 tips for designers who want to create cloud native apps

{{< admonition abstract "Abstract" false >}}
Kubernetes and cloud technologies are nowadays the new standard to deploy different cloud native applications: API, BATCHES, microservices and ... monoliths!
These technologies help to solve many issues but with some complexity.
It could be difficult for developers and designers to identify the constraints of such architectures.

In this presentation, you will (re)discover ten tips and pieces of advice I applied and found useful in my last JAVA projects (Spring, JEE).

I will talk about:

Application ecosystem
Choice of technical solutions
Development
K8S design constraints
And more!
