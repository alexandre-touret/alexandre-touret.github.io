            </div><h2 id="introduction" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#introduction" class="header-mark"></a>1 Introduction</h2><p>Last week, I had the opportunity to lead a workshop on Software Architecture at <a href="rivieradev.fr/" rel="">Riviera Dev</a>.</p>
<p>With the help of <a href="https://dev.to/yostane" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my colleague Yassine Benabbas</a>, more than sixty participants learned and improved their design and architecture skills through a three-hour Architecture Kata based on a (not so) real-life use case.</p>
<p>If you are not familiar with Architecture Katas, I suggest you take a look at the following links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/xLhb3mvweDI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A video captured during a conference</a> and <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/alexandretouret/architecture-katas-improve-your-system-architecture-design-skills-in-a-fun-way" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the slides</a> where I introduce the concept.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.worldline.tech/2019/12/12/architecture-katas.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An article from the Worldline Tech Blog</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, as a follow-up, I will present some of the solutions proposed by the participants and then share my own proposition.</p>
<h2 id="the-kata" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#the-kata" class="header-mark"></a>2 The Kata</h2><p>Before diving into the different solutions, <a href="/assets/images/2025/07/kata_rivieradev.pdf" rel="">here is the Kata (in French)</a>.</p>
<p>In short, the main objective was to design an innovative digital platform to promote sustainable and solidarity-based tourism. The platform targeted eco-conscious travelers, local ecological associations, and responsible tourism service providers.</p>
<p>Key features included user profiles with eco-friendly booking options, carbon footprint dashboards, gamification, and activity tracking. Associations could publish volunteer initiatives and gather support, while service providers could manage eco-labeled offers and reservations. IoT sensors monitored environmental quality, and integration with connected mobility enhanced eco-actions.</p>
<p>During this workshop, my colleague and I did our best to help more than ten teams design this platform. We assisted them in making assumptions, overcoming the blank page challenge, and validating their designs.</p>
<p>I present here three solutions. The first two drafts were created by two different teams and are published with their agreement.</p>
<h2 id="first-proposition" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#first-proposition" class="header-mark"></a>3 First proposition</h2><p>Most of the attendees worked at Amadeus. They definitively used to with this kind of use case.
Among of them, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-ceelen-5891a33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Christian Ceelen</a> and his team proposed this solution.</p>
<p>Here are some the diagrams made by Christian, and to be honest I was totally impressed!</p>

<h3 id="my-approach-in-nutshell" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#my-approach-in-nutshell" class="header-mark"></a>5.1 My approach (in nutshell)</h3><p>Here are some of the guidelines I gave to the attendees:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start asking &ldquo;Why a new app?</li>
<li>Pinpoint the Business &amp; Non-Functional Requirements  and the key figures</li>
<li>Dig into the design step by step</li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, when some of them were completely stuck, I gave this pice of advice: start identify the main business flows and design your platform upon these ones.</p>
<p>Finally, throughout the design, it&rsquo;s really important to focus on the core business and give the opportunity to re-use external services.</p>
<h4 id="business-flows" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#business-flows" class="header-mark"></a>5.1.1 Business Flows</h4><ol>
<li>Searching, booking, traveller profile &amp; dashboard</li>
<li>Local &amp; sustainable activities publishing, enrollment &amp; management</li>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Payment, donations</li>
<li>IoT metrics gathering &amp; dashboards</li>
<li>Mobile &amp; Web interactions</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="nfrs" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#nfrs" class="header-mark"></a>5.1.2 NFRs</h4><p>The NFRs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_disaster_recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RTO, RPO</a>) are very well described in the document. Both the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_disaster_recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RTO &amp; RPO</a> definition are prioritized according to the business functionalities.</p>
<p>For instance, we can check that the financial transactions are highly criticals.
Therefore, it makes sense to reuse and buy an external service which could handle such a requirements.</p>
<h4 id="high-level-design-system-view" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#high-level-design-system-view" class="header-mark"></a>5.1.3 High level design (System View)</h4><h5 id="assumptions" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#assumptions" class="header-mark"></a>5.1.3.1 Assumptions</h5><p>As said above, I chose not to implement the payment/donations functionality and use/buy an external service. It helps me avoid dealing with the strong RTO &amp; RPO and the related compliancy (i.e., <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCI-DSS</a>).</p>
<p>Then, I chose not to include the IoT sensors in my design. Instead, I decided to require all sensors to comply with a mandatory service contract.</p>
<h5 id="actors--external-systems" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#actors--external-systems" class="header-mark"></a>5.1.3.2 Actors &amp; external systems</h5><p>I identified the different actors :</p>
<ul>
<li>Traveller</li>
<li>Sustainable Travel Service Provider</li>
</ul>
<p>And the external services:</p>
<ul>
<li>IOT Devices</li>
<li>PSP (Payment Service Provider)</li>

<p>As the saying goes: put three architects in a room with one platform to design, and you&rsquo;ll probably end up with four solutions.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, when faced with such dilemmas, it&rsquo;s best to choose the simplest and most adaptable solution.</p>

            </div><h2 id="introduction" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#introduction" class="header-mark"></a>1 Introduction</h2><p>Recently, I had the opportunity to participate in <a href="https://www.jchateau.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JChateau</a> and <a href="https://www.devoxx.fr/agenda-2025/talk/ensemble-faisons-progresser-et-grandir-les-developpeurs-debutants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devoxx France</a>.
At these two events, I organized and facilitated roundtables on how to onboard, mentor, and manage young developers to help them grow and improve over time.</p>
<p>For many years, I have been managing young developers, including trainees and developers with less than one year of experience.
Additionally, I have been involved in various mentoring programs. For example, I have helped young students prepare for their first interviews and guided them to succeed.</p>
<p>Since last year, I <a href="https://blog.touret.info/teaching/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have also been teaching at the University of Tours</a>.</p>
<p>These experiences, especially early in my career, often left me feeling slightly frustrated or conflicted. Why? Because I had the impression of reinventing the wheel. I was certain that others had faced similar challenges and had developed smart solutions or patterns to address them.</p>
<p>This is why I have been sharing my experiences in this field through various channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Conferences</li>
<li>Workshops</li>
<li>Articles (<a href="https://blog.worldline.tech/2024/06/04/elevating_young_developers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In English</a> or <a href="https://blog.touret.info/2019/07/17/comment-coacher-des-jeunes-developpeurs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in French</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have noticed a high demand for discussions on this topic.
Every time I speak about it, the subject resonates strongly with the audience.</p>
<p>For instance, at <a href="https://www.devoxx.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Devoxx France</a>, I was thrilled to see more than 40 people attend my BOF (at 7 PM!) and share their experiences on this topic.</p>
<p>As a result, I will attempt to summarize all the conclusions, questions, and insights I encountered during these meaningful discussions.</p>
<h2 id="jchateau" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#jchateau" class="header-mark"></a>2 JChateau</h2><p>I proposed this topic at JChateau. Although it was far beyond the usual technical topics, I managed to arrange a roundtable with four people on the second day.</p>
<p><img class="tw-inline" loading="lazy" src='/assets/images/2025/05/IMG_20250328_085525340.jpg'   alt="Agenda"  ></p>
<p>The discussions were truly insightful. The audience consisted of seasoned engineers, software architects, and one person involved in training young students.</p>
<p>We agreed that there is a significant gap between the way coding is taught at universities or engineering schools and how it is practiced in IT companies. The skills learned at school often don&rsquo;t align with the requirements of a real-life production platform.</p>
<p>To some extent, it&rsquo;s more important <em>to learn how to learn</em> through algorithms, mathematics, and analysis than to simply learn the latest trendy framework.<br>
The pace of technological evolution is both overwhelming and fascinating.<br>
Moreover, the learning curve for developers is incredibly steep nowadays. Beyond mastering a favorite programming language, one must also learn to use Docker, build tools, Bash, database tools/queries, cloud commands, and many others.<br>
It&rsquo;s nearly impossible to address all these skills comprehensively in school.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why, when I&rsquo;m looking for a new young engineer, I prioritize a <em>well-prepared mind</em> over specific technical skills.</p>
<p>We also shared a common observation:<br>
It&rsquo;s essential to teach the basics while onboarding young developers: logs, error management, tests, and so on.</p>
<p>The million-dollar question then arose: Who should take responsibility for this—universities/schools or our industry?</p>
<p>In conclusion, we leaned slightly toward the idea that our industry should share a common program to teach the fundamentals of development.<br>
At this stage, I am unsure whether we should adopt a bottom-up or a top-down approach. I assume that some large IT companies already have onboarding and training programs for this purpose.<br>
It would be fantastic if we could pool our efforts and, for example, create a dedicated open-source project with materials such as workshops, documentation, and more.</p>
<h2 id="devoxx-france" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#devoxx-france" class="header-mark"></a>3 Devoxx France</h2><p>As I mentioned earlier in my introduction, I also had the opportunity to share my experiences in this field at Devoxx France.<br>
During a <a href="https://www.devoxx.fr/en/questions-frequentes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BOF (Birds Of a Feather)</a>, I began by sharing my thoughts based on my experiences and the topics I had discussed in previous conferences. I did this to explain why I decided to share insights and feedback on this subject.</p>
<p>To engage the audience (40 people at 7 PM after a full day of the conference!), I chose to organize a <a href="https://leancoffee.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lean coffee</a> session.<br>
The main goal was to have a discussion split into two distinct 15-minute time slots.<br>
I then invited participants to write down any topics they wanted to address on post-it notes.<br>
I was pleasantly surprised by the number of ideas and topics that emerged.<br>
Gathering all of these could almost be described as a DDOS post-it attack!</p>

    </figure>
<p>With the help of my colleagues and people I knew —<a href="https://raphiki.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raphaël Semeteys</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yatho" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yann-Thomas Le Moigne</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidpequegnot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Pequegnot</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lo%C3%AFc-le-meur-23a159174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Loïc Le Meur</a> — we categorized all the post-it notes and identified two main topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Methodology, documentation, and support</li>
<li>Soft skills</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the topics and ideas thrown during this free chat:</p>
<h3 id="methodology-documentation-and-support" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#methodology-documentation-and-support" class="header-mark"></a>3.1 Methodology, documentation, and support</h3><p>During this discussion, many points were raised.
We emphasized the necessity of arranging labs and dojos where (not only) young developers could dive into best practices alongside seasoned developers.
By the way, the <em>&ldquo;Pair programming&rdquo; topic</em> was highly requested during the Post-It brainstorming session.
Using such a practice, you would both instill good practices and help developers grow their skills.
Next, you could build on this and reuse it regularly.</p>
<p>Additionally, organizing internal tech conferences could also contribute to this effort.</p>
<p>Beyond these two topics, we highlighted the importance of fostering a tech culture within our organizations.
Arranging workshops or tech conferences and drafting articles are excellent ways to promote good practices and improve all developers. Furthermore, we might consider creating workshops for either live pair-programming sessions or self-paced learning.</p>
<p>Similarly, we discussed the importance of documentation for everyone, especially young developers.
You must teach them how to use it and ensure all your processes are as exhaustive as possible. This would help avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we addressed one of the trickiest points: time management.</p>
<p>This is perhaps one of the most significant challenges to tackle.</p>
<p>How can we emphasize the importance of dedicating time to onboarding and managing young developers?
Nowadays, it can be challenging, but in my view, it should be considered an investment. If you don&rsquo;t invest time and resources, you won&rsquo;t achieve a good return on investment.</p>
<p>Remember: <em>&ldquo;If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.&rdquo;</em></p>
<h3 id="soft-skills" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#soft-skills" class="header-mark"></a>3.2 Soft skills</h3><p>This was probably the most eagerly awaited topic.<br>
We shared many of our good and bad experiences in managing young developers.<br>
We then agreed on the necessity of being trained in management, even if we are not managers.<br>
Knowing how to train others would also be a key topic.</p>
<p>I believe this could be crucial for optimizing the onboarding process and the learning path. It may also help avoid mistakes and establish the right approach.<br>
We also identified two important soft skills: exemplarity and empathy.</p>
<p>Exemplarity could be the first step in promoting a safe environment where young developers can learn, fail, and find solutions without fear.<br>
Empathy, in my view, is essential for adapting the workload or training to suit your new young colleague. It is critical to understand that, from their perspective, they are entering an entirely new world where everything feels completely different.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up" class="headerLink">
    <a href="#wrap-up" class="header-mark"></a>4 Wrap-up</h2><p>Through all the interactions I had during the recent conferences where I presented this topic, I noticed it is a common concern in our industry.<br>
Many people highlighted the challenges of managing young developers.<br>
Guiding them to reach the &ldquo;plateau of productivity&rdquo; is a long journey that requires a combination of technical and soft skills.</p>
<p>I strongly believe our industry needs to address this topic collectively.<br>
Creating a shared learning path among IT companies that covers the fundamentals of development could be a significant first step.</p>
<p>For example, at Worldline, together with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/phivincent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippe Vincent</a>, we developed a <a href="https://github.com/worldline/code-quality-workshop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quality code workshop</a>.<br>
We recognize that this is just the beginning and only one of the initial steps.</p>
<p>Perhaps we could combine our efforts on this topic. What do you think?</p>
