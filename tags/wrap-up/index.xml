    <a href="#2023-in-a-nutshell" class="header-mark"></a>1 2023 in a Nutshell</h2><p>As we approach 2024, it’s time to cast a professional eye back on 2023.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, I&rsquo;ve balanced work on a customer project alongside my contributions to the Worldline TechRel<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> initiative. Each involvement has fueled the other, offering a reciprocal flow of inspiration. Involvement in real-life projects has often sparked new ideas for talks and topics to delve into. In turn, my experiences in Dev Rel have offered fresh perspectives and external feedback, enriching the implementation process.</p>
<p>Highlights of my speaking engagements this year include:</p>
<ul>
<li>6 tech conferences</li>
<li>4 meetups</li>
<li>A Worldline tech event in Barcelona</li>
<li>An online presentation (i.e., <a href="http://www.brownbaglunch.fr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BBL</a>) for <a href="https://www.abbeal.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABBEAL</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This year, unlike the previous one, I found myself presenting two talks or a talk and a workshop at the same conference—a challenging but exciting experience! Consequently, I delivered a similar number of talks compared to 2022.</p>
<p>My primary topics this year included:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8DbVbMDe2w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rest API Versioning</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/vxwqD3KwdEY?si=n7L4p0USvdADFuct" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hitchhiker&rsquo;s Guide to Software Architecture Design</a></li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/xLhb3mvweDI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Architecture Katas</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Notably, I co-presented the second talk with my colleague <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/raphaelsemeteys" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raphaël Semeteys</a>, extending my collaborative speaking initiatives that commenced in 2022 with <a href="https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jefrajames" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jean-François James</a> (I shared <a href="https://lyonjug.org/2023/02/21/architecture-katas-and-microservices.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the stage with him at LyonJUG</a>).
This collaborative process has been immensely rewarding. It helps me push me beyond my comfort zone, enabling me to approach various topics from a fresh perspective.
A prime example was our exploration of discussing software architecture in a more light-hearted and unconventional manner, which initially seemed improbable to me.</p>
<p>In fact, I intend to explore more partnerships in the future.</p>
<p>Moreover, I participated in the recent <a href="http://jchateau.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JChateau Edition</a>, my initiation into the world of &ldquo;unconferences&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.junconf.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JunConf</a>)—an incredibly enriching experience! Interacting with inspiring individuals like <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmdoudoux/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_people_connections%3Bb0ogWmkZSA%2BqSqaqCW4rDw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jean-Michel Doudoux</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/aalmiray/?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_people_connections%3Bb0ogWmkZSA%2BqSqaqCW4rDw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Andres Almirez</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jos%C3%A9-paumard-2458ba5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">José Paumard</a> was truly inspiring.</p>
<p>During the year, I released six articles on <a href="https://blog.touret.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my blog</a> and one on the <a href="https://blog.worldline.tech/authors/#alexandre-touret" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Worldline engineering blog</a>.</p>
<p>I express my gratitude to my employer for the continued opportunities and to the organizers for their unwavering trust and hospitality. Your support has been instrumental in my journey.</p>
<p>The Worldline TechRel initiative has been instrumental in exploring new topics and facilitating collaborations with colleagues.
It has enabled me to share, gather feedback on submissions, and conduct live rehearsals (Thanks <a href="https://mariealiceblete.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marie-Alice Blete</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philippe-vincent-732a3217/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philippe Vincent</a> and the others).</p>
<p>Heartfelt thanks to all who have supported me along this journey!</p>

    <a href="#what-lies-ahead" class="header-mark"></a>2 What Lies Ahead?</h2><p>Through the <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>Worldline TechRel initiative, I&rsquo;ve had the privilege of meeting exceptional individuals and advancing in various technical domains. Crafting and presenting talks on technical subjects demand in-depth knowledge, and this has already sparked ideas for the upcoming year.</p>
<p>Kicking off the new year with a bang, I am thrilled to announce a workshop at NDC London in late January (<a href="https://ndclondon.com/agenda/rest-apis-versioning-hands-on-0ah8/0srvy242ytv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">details here</a>). Additionally, I will be co-presenting a new talk with <a href="malkav30.gitlab.io/" rel="">my colleague Philippe Duval</a> at <a href="https://touraine.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Touraine Tech</a>.</p>
<p>Wishing everyone a fantastic New Year&rsquo;s Eve, and if you come across this article in 2024: Happy New Year!!</p>
